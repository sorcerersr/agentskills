# Language Features

This section delineates which features may or may not be used, and any additional constraints on their use.

Language features which are not discussed in this style guide *may* be used with no recommendations of their usage.

## Local variable declarations

### Use const and let

Always use `const` or `let` to declare variables. Use `const` by default, unless a variable needs to be reassigned. Never use `var`.

**Good:**
```ts
const foo = otherValue;  // Use if "foo" never changes.
let bar = someValue;     // Use if "bar" is ever assigned into later on.
```

`const` and `let` are block scoped, like variables in most other languages. `var` in JavaScript is function scoped, which can cause difficult to understand bugs. Don't use it.

**Bad:**
```ts
var foo = someValue;     // Don't use - var scoping is complex and causes bugs.
```

Variables *must not* be used before their declaration.

### One variable per declaration

Every local variable declaration declares only one variable: declarations such as `let a = 1, b = 2;` are not used.

## Array literals

### Do not use the `Array` constructor

*Do not* use the `Array()` constructor, with or without `new`. It has confusing and contradictory usage:

**Bad:**
```ts
const a = new Array(2); // [undefined, undefined]
const b = new Array(2, 3); // [2, 3];
```

Instead, always use bracket notation to initialize arrays, or `from` to initialize an `Array` with a certain size:

**Good:**
```ts
const a = [2];
const b = [2, 3];

// Equivalent to Array(2):
const c = [];
c.length = 2;

// [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Array.from<number>({length: 5}).fill(0);
```

### Do not define properties on arrays

Do not define or use non-numeric properties on an array (other than `length`). Use a `Map` (or `Object`) instead.

### Using spread syntax

Using spread syntax `[...foo];` is a convenient shorthand for shallow-copying or concatenating iterables.

**Good:**
```ts
const foo = [
  1,
];

const foo2 = [
  ...foo,
  6,
  7,
];

const foo3 = [
  5,
  ...foo,
];

foo2[1] === 6;
foo3[1] === 1;
```

When using spread syntax, the value being spread *must* match what is being created. When creating an array, only spread iterables. Primitives (including `null` and `undefined`) *must not* be spread.

**Bad:**
```ts
const foo = [7];
const bar = [5, ...(shouldUseFoo && foo)]; // might be undefined

// Creates {0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c'} but has no length
const fooStrings = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const ids = {...fooStrings};
```

**Good:**
```ts
const foo = shouldUseFoo ? [7] : [];
const bar = [5, ...foo];
const fooStrings = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const ids = [...fooStrings, 'd', 'e'];
```

### Array destructuring

Array literals may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment to perform destructuring (such as when unpacking multiple values from a single array or iterable). A final “rest” element may be included (with no space between the `...` and the variable name). Elements should be omitted if they are unused.

**Good:**
```ts
const [a, b, c, ...rest] = generateResults();
let [, b,, d] = someArray;
```

Destructuring may also be used for function parameters. Always specify `[]` as the default value if a destructured array parameter is optional, and provide default values on the left hand side:

**Good:**
```ts
function destructured([a = 4, b = 2] = []) { … }
```

Disallowed:

**Bad:**
```ts
function badDestructuring([a, b] = [4, 2]) { … }
```

Tip: For (un)packing multiple values into a function’s parameter or return, prefer object destructuring to array destructuring when possible, as it allows naming the individual elements and specifying a different type for each.

## Object literals

### Do not use the `Object` constructor

The `Object` constructor is disallowed. Use an object literal (`{}` or `{a: 0, b: 1, c: 2}`) instead.

### Iterating objects

Iterating objects with `for (... in ...)` is error prone. It will include enumerable properties from the prototype chain.

Do not use unfiltered `for (... in ...)` statements:

**Bad:**
```ts
for (const x in someObj) {
  // x could come from some parent prototype!
}
```

Either filter values explicitly with an `if` statement, or use `for (... of Object.keys(...))`.

**Good:**
```ts
for (const x in someObj) {
  if (!someObj.hasOwnProperty(x)) continue;
  // now x was definitely defined on someObj
}
for (const x of Object.keys(someObj)) { // note: for _of_!
  // now x was definitely defined on someObj
}
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(someObj)) { // note: for _of_!
  // now key was definitely defined on someObj
}
```

### Using spread syntax

Using spread syntax `{...bar}` is a convenient shorthand for creating a shallow copy of an object. When using spread syntax in object initialization, later values replace earlier values at the same key.

**Good:**
```ts
const foo = {
  num: 1,
};

const foo2 = {
  ...foo,
  num: 5,
};

const foo3 = {
  num: 5,
  ...foo,
}

foo2.num === 5;
foo3.num === 1;
```

When using spread syntax, the value being spread *must* match what is being created. That is, when creating an object, only objects may be spread; arrays and primitives (including `null` and `undefined`) *must not* be spread. Avoid spreading objects that have prototypes other than the Object prototype (e.g. class definitions, class instances, functions) as the behavior is unintuitive (only enumerable non-prototype properties are shallow-copied).

**Bad:**
```ts
const foo = {num: 7};
const bar = {num: 5, ...(shouldUseFoo && foo)}; // might be undefined

// Creates {0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c'} but has no length
const fooStrings = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
const ids = {...fooStrings};
```

**Good:**
```ts
const foo = shouldUseFoo ? {num: 7} : {};
const bar = {num: 5, ...foo};
```

### Computed property names

Computed property names (e.g. `{['key' + foo()]: 42}`) are allowed, and are considered dict-style (quoted) keys (i.e., must not be mixed with non-quoted keys) unless the computed property is a [symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) (e.g. `[Symbol.iterator]`).

### Object destructuring

Object destructuring patterns may be used on the left-hand side of an assignment to perform destructuring and unpack multiple values from a single object.

Destructured objects may also be used as function parameters, but should be kept as simple as possible: a single level of unquoted shorthand properties. Deeper levels of nesting and computed properties may not be used in parameter destructuring. Specify any default values in the left-hand-side of the destructured parameter (`{str = 'some default'} = {}`, rather than `{str} = {str: 'some default'}`), and if a destructured object is itself optional, it must default to `{}`.

Example:

**Good:**
```ts
interface Options {
  /** The number of times to do something. */
  num?: number;

  /** A string to do stuff to. */
  str?: string;
}

function destructured({num, str = 'default'}: Options = {}) {}
```

Disallowed:

**Bad:**
```ts
function nestedTooDeeply({x: {num, str}}: {x: Options}) {}
function nontrivialDefault({num, str}: Options = {num: 42, str: 'default'}) {}
```

## Classes

### Class declarations

Class declarations *must not* be terminated with semicolons:

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
}; // Unnecessary semicolon
```

In contrast, statements that contain class expressions *must* be terminated with a semicolon:

**Good:**
```ts
export const Baz = class extends Bar {
  method(): number {
    return this.x;
  }
}; // Semicolon here as this is a statement, not a declaration
```

**Bad:**
```ts
exports const Baz = class extends Bar {
  method(): number {
    return this.x;
  }
}
```

It is neither encouraged nor discouraged to have blank lines separating class declaration braces from other class content:

**Good:**
```ts
// No spaces around braces - fine.
class Baz {
  method(): number {
    return this.x;
  }
}

// A single space around both braces - also fine.
class Foo {

  method(): number {
    return this.x;
  }

}
```

### Class method declarations

Class method declarations *must not* use a semicolon to separate individual method declarations:

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  doThing() {
    console.log("A");
  }
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
  doThing() {
    console.log("A");
  }; // <-- unnecessary
}
```

Method declarations should be separated from surrounding code by a single blank line:

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  doThing() {
    console.log("A");
  }

  getOtherThing(): number {
    return 4;
  }
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
  doThing() {
    console.log("A");
  }
  getOtherThing(): number {
    return 4;
  }
}
```

#### Overriding toString

The `toString` method may be overridden, but must always succeed and never have visible side effects.

Tip: Beware, in particular, of calling other methods from toString, since exceptional conditions could lead to infinite loops.

### Static methods

#### Avoid private static methods

Where it does not interfere with readability, prefer module-local functions over private static methods.

#### Do not rely on dynamic dispatch

Code *should not* rely on dynamic dispatch of static methods. Static methods *should* only be called on the base class itself (which defines it directly). Static methods *should not* be called on variables containing a dynamic instance that may be either the constructor or a subclass constructor (and *must* be defined with `@nocollapse` if this is done), and *must not* be called directly on a subclass that doesn’t define the method itself.

Disallowed:

**Bad:**
```ts
// Context for the examples below (this class is okay by itself)
class Base {
  /** @nocollapse */ static foo() {}
}
class Sub extends Base {}

// Discouraged: don't call static methods dynamically
function callFoo(cls: typeof Base) {
  cls.foo();
}

// Disallowed: don't call static methods on subclasses that don't define it themselves
Sub.foo();

// Disallowed: don't access this in static methods.
class MyClass {
  static foo() {
    return this.staticField;
  }
}
MyClass.staticField = 1;
```

#### Avoid static `this` references

Code *must not* use `this` in a static context.

JavaScript allows accessing static fields through `this`. Different from other languages, static fields are also inherited.

**Bad:**
```ts
class ShoeStore {
  static storage: Storage = ...;

  static isAvailable(s: Shoe) {
    // Bad: do not use `this` in a static method.
    return this.storage.has(s.id);
  }
}

class EmptyShoeStore extends ShoeStore {
  static storage: Storage = EMPTY_STORE;  // overrides storage from ShoeStore
}
```

**Why?**

This code is generally surprising: authors might not expect that static fields can be accessed through the this pointer, and might be surprised to find that they can be overridden - this feature is not commonly used.

This code also encourages an anti-pattern of having substantial static state, which causes problems with testability.

### Constructors

Constructor calls *must* use parentheses, even when no arguments are passed:

**Bad:**
```ts
const x = new Foo;
```

**Good:**
```ts
const x = new Foo();
```

Omitting parentheses can lead to subtle mistakes. These two lines are not equivalent:

**Good:**
```js
new Foo().Bar();
new Foo.Bar();
```

It is unnecessary to provide an empty constructor or one that simply delegates into its parent class because ES2015 provides a default class constructor if one is not specified. However constructors with parameter properties, visibility modifiers or parameter decorators *should not* be omitted even if the body of the constructor is empty.

**Bad:**
```ts
class UnnecessaryConstructor {
  constructor() {}
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
class UnnecessaryConstructorOverride extends Base {
    constructor(value: number) {
      super(value);
    }
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
class DefaultConstructor {
}

class ParameterProperties {
  constructor(private myService) {}
}

class ParameterDecorators {
  constructor(@SideEffectDecorator myService) {}
}

class NoInstantiation {
  private constructor() {}
}
```

The constructor should be separated from surrounding code both above and below by a single blank line:

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  myField = 10;

  constructor(private readonly ctorParam) {}

  doThing() {
    console.log(ctorParam.getThing() + myField);
  }
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
  myField = 10;
  constructor(private readonly ctorParam) {}
  doThing() {
    console.log(ctorParam.getThing() + myField);
  }
}
```

### Class members

#### No #private fields

Do not use private fields (also known as private identifiers):

**Bad:**
```ts
class Clazz {
  #ident = 1;
}
```

Instead, use TypeScript's visibility annotations:

**Good:**
```ts
class Clazz {
  private ident = 1;
}
```

**Why?**

Private identifiers cause substantial emit size and performance regressions when down-leveled by TypeScript, and are unsupported before ES2015. They can only be downleveled to ES2015, not lower. At the same time, they do not offer substantial benefits when static type checking is used to enforce visibility.

#### Use readonly

Mark properties that are never reassigned outside of the constructor with the `readonly` modifier (these need not be deeply immutable).

#### Parameter properties

Rather than plumbing an obvious initializer through to a class member, use a TypeScript [parameter property](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#parameter-properties).

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
  private readonly barService: BarService;

  constructor(barService: BarService) {
    this.barService = barService;
  }
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  constructor(private readonly barService: BarService) {}
}
```

If the parameter property needs documentation, use an `@param` JSDoc tag.

#### Field initializers

If a class member is not a parameter, initialize it where it's declared, which sometimes lets you drop the constructor entirely.

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
  private readonly userList: string[];

  constructor() {
    this.userList = [];
  }
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  private readonly userList: string[] = [];
}
```

Tip: Properties should never be added to or removed from an instance after the constructor is finished, since it significantly hinders VMs’ ability to optimize classes' “shape”. Optional fields that may be filled in later should be explicitly initialized to `undefined` to prevent later shape changes.

#### Properties used outside of class lexical scope

Properties used from outside the lexical scope of their containing class, such as an Angular component's properties used from a template, *must not* use `private` visibility, as they are used outside of the lexical scope of their containing class.

Use either `protected` or `public` as appropriate to the property in question. Angular and AngularJS template properties should use `protected`, but Polymer should use `public`.

TypeScript code *must not* use `obj['foo']` to bypass the visibility of a property.

**Why?**

When a property is `private`, you are declaring to both automated systems and humans that the property accesses are scoped to the methods of the declaring class, and they will rely on that. For example, a check for unused code will flag a private property that appears to be unused, even if some other file manages to bypass the visibility restriction.

Though it might appear that `obj['foo']` can bypass visibility in the TypeScript compiler, this pattern can be broken by rearranging the build rules, and also violates optimization compatibility.

#### Getters and setters

Getters and setters, also known as accessors, for class members *may* be used. The getter method *must* be a [pure function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) (i.e., result is consistent and has no side effects: getters *must not* change observable state). They are also useful as a means of restricting the visibility of internal or verbose implementation details (shown below).

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  constructor(private readonly someService: SomeService) {}

  get someMember(): string {
    return this.someService.someVariable;
  }

  set someMember(newValue: string) {
    this.someService.someVariable = newValue;
  }
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
  nextId = 0;
  get next() {
    return this.nextId++; // Bad: getter changes observable state
  }
}
```

If an accessor is used to hide a class property, the hidden property *may* be prefixed or suffixed with any whole word, like `internal` or `wrapped`. When using these private properties, access the value through the accessor whenever possible. At least one accessor for a property *must* be non-trivial: do not define “pass-through” accessors only for the purpose of hiding a property. Instead, make the property public (or consider making it `readonly` rather than just defining a getter with no setter).

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  private wrappedBar = '';
  get bar() {
    return this.wrappedBar || 'bar';
  }

  set bar(wrapped: string) {
    this.wrappedBar = wrapped.trim();
  }
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
class Bar {
  private barInternal = '';
  // Neither of these accessors have logic, so just make bar public.
  get bar() {
    return this.barInternal;
  }

  set bar(value: string) {
    this.barInternal = value;
  }
}
```

Getters and setters *must not* be defined using `Object.defineProperty`, since this interferes with property renaming.

#### Computed properties

Computed properties may only be used in classes when the property is a symbol. Dict-style properties (that is, quoted or computed non-symbol keys) are not allowed (see rationale for not mixing key types. A `[Symbol.iterator]` method should be defined for any classes that are logically iterable. Beyond this, `Symbol` should be used sparingly.

Tip: be careful of using any other built-in symbols (e.g. `Symbol.isConcatSpreadable`) as they are not polyfilled by the compiler and will therefore not work in older browsers.

### Visibility

Restricting visibility of properties, methods, and entire types helps with keeping code decoupled.

- Limit symbol visibility as much as possible.

- Consider converting private methods to non-exported functions within the same file but outside of any class, and moving private properties into a separate, non-exported class.

- TypeScript symbols are public by default. Never use the `public` modifier except when declaring non-readonly public parameter properties (in constructors).

**Bad:**
```ts
class Foo {
  public bar = new Bar();  // BAD: public modifier not needed

  constructor(public readonly baz: Baz) {}  // BAD: readonly implies it's a property which defaults to public
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
class Foo {
  bar = new Bar();  // GOOD: public modifier not needed

  constructor(public baz: Baz) {}  // public modifier allowed
}
```

See also export visibility.

### Disallowed class patterns

#### Do not manipulate `prototype`s directly

The `class` keyword allows clearer and more readable class definitions than defining `prototype` properties. Ordinary implementation code has no business manipulating these objects. Mixins and modifying the prototypes of builtin objects are explicitly forbidden.

**Exception**: Framework code (such as Polymer, or Angular) may need to use `prototype`s, and should not resort to even-worse workarounds to avoid doing so.

## Functions

### Terminology

There are many different types of functions, with subtle distinctions between them. This guide uses the following terminology, which aligns with [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions):

- “function declaration”: a declaration (i.e. not an expression) using the `function` keyword

- “function expression”: an expression, typically used in an assignment or passed as a parameter, using the `function` keyword

- “arrow function”: an expression using the `=>` syntax

- “block body”: right hand side of an arrow function with braces

- “concise body”: right hand side of an arrow function without braces

Methods and classes/constructors are not covered in this section.

### Prefer function declarations for named functions

Prefer function declarations over arrow functions or function expressions when defining named functions.

**Good:**
```ts
function foo() {
  return 42;
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
const foo = () => 42;
```

Arrow functions *may* be used, for example, when an explicit type annotation is required.

**Good:**
```ts
interface SearchFunction {
  (source: string, subString: string): boolean;
}

const fooSearch: SearchFunction = (source, subString) => { ... };
```

### Nested functions

Functions nested within other methods or functions *may* use function declarations or arrow functions, as appropriate. In method bodies in particular, arrow functions are preferred because they have access to the outer `this`.

### Do not use function expressions

Do not use function expressions. Use arrow functions instead.

**Good:**
```ts
bar(() => { this.doSomething(); })
```

**Bad:**
```ts
bar(function() { ... })
```

**Exception:** Function expressions *may* be used *only if* code has to dynamically rebind `this` (but this is discouraged), or for generator functions (which do not have an arrow syntax).

### Arrow function bodies

Use arrow functions with concise bodies (i.e. expressions) or block bodies as appropriate.

**Good:**
```ts
// Top level functions use function declarations.
function someFunction() {
  // Block bodies are fine:
  const receipts = books.map((b: Book) => {
    const receipt = payMoney(b.price);
    recordTransaction(receipt);
    return receipt;
  });

  // Concise bodies are fine, too, if the return value is used:
  const longThings = myValues.filter(v => v.length > 1000).map(v => String(v));

  function payMoney(amount: number) {
    // function declarations are fine, but must not access `this`.
  }

  // Nested arrow functions may be assigned to a const.
  const computeTax = (amount: number) => amount * 0.12;
}
```

Only use a concise body if the return value of the function is actually used. The block body makes sure the return type is `void` then and prevents potential side effects.

**Bad:**
```ts
// BAD: use a block body if the return value of the function is not used.
myPromise.then(v => console.log(v));
// BAD: this typechecks, but the return value still leaks.
let f: () => void;
f = () => 1;
```

**Good:**
```ts
// GOOD: return value is unused, use a block body.
myPromise.then(v => {
  console.log(v);
});
// GOOD: code may use blocks for readability.
const transformed = [1, 2, 3].map(v => {
  const intermediate = someComplicatedExpr(v);
  const more = acrossManyLines(intermediate);
  return worthWrapping(more);
});
// GOOD: explicit `void` ensures no leaked return value
myPromise.then(v => void console.log(v));
```

Tip: The `void` operator can be used to ensure an arrow function with an expression body returns `undefined` when the result is unused.

### Rebinding `this`

Function expressions and function declarations *must not* use `this` unless they specifically exist to rebind the `this` pointer. Rebinding `this` can in most cases be avoided by using arrow functions or explicit parameters.

**Bad:**
```ts
function clickHandler() {
  // Bad: what's `this` in this context?
  this.textContent = 'Hello';
}
// Bad: the `this` pointer reference is implicitly set to document.body.
document.body.onclick = clickHandler;
```

**Good:**
```ts
// Good: explicitly reference the object from an arrow function.
document.body.onclick = () => { document.body.textContent = 'hello'; };
// Alternatively: take an explicit parameter
const setTextFn = (e: HTMLElement) => { e.textContent = 'hello'; };
document.body.onclick = setTextFn.bind(null, document.body);
```

Prefer arrow functions over other approaches to binding `this`, such as `f.bind(this)`, `goog.bind(f, this)`, or `const self = this`.

### Prefer passing arrow functions as callbacks

Callbacks can be invoked with unexpected arguments that can pass a type check but still result in logical errors.

Avoid passing a named callback to a higher-order function, unless you are sure of the stability of both functions' call signatures. Beware, in particular, of less-commonly-used optional parameters.

**Bad:**
```ts
// BAD: Arguments are not explicitly passed, leading to unintended behavior
// when the optional `radix` argument gets the array indices 0, 1, and 2.
const numbers = ['11', '5', '10'].map(parseInt);
// > [11, NaN, 2];
```

Instead, prefer passing an arrow-function that explicitly forwards parameters to the named callback.

**Good:**
```ts
// GOOD: Arguments are explicitly passed to the callback
const numbers = ['11', '5', '3'].map((n) => parseInt(n));
// > [11, 5, 3]

// GOOD: Function is locally defined and is designed to be used as a callback
function dayFilter(element: string|null|undefined) {
  return element != null && element.endsWith('day');
}

const days = ['tuesday', undefined, 'juice', 'wednesday'].filter(dayFilter);
```

### Arrow functions as properties

Classes usually *should not* contain properties initialized to arrow functions. Arrow function properties require the calling function to understand that the callee's `this` is already bound, which increases confusion about what `this` is, and call sites and references using such handlers look broken (i.e. require non-local knowledge to determine that they are correct). Code *should* always use arrow functions to call instance methods (`const handler = (x) => { this.listener(x); };`), and *should not* obtain or pass references to instance methods (~~`const handler = this.listener; handler(x);`~~).

> Note: in some specific situations, e.g. when binding functions in a template, arrow functions as properties are useful and create much more readable code. Use judgement with this rule. Also, see the `Event Handlers` section below.

**Bad:**
```ts
class DelayHandler {
  constructor() {
    // Problem: `this` is not preserved in the callback. `this` in the callback
    // will not be an instance of DelayHandler.
    setTimeout(this.patienceTracker, 5000);
  }
  private patienceTracker() {
    this.waitedPatiently = true;
  }
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
// Arrow functions usually should not be properties.
class DelayHandler {
  constructor() {
    // Bad: this code looks like it forgot to bind `this`.
    setTimeout(this.patienceTracker, 5000);
  }
  private patienceTracker = () => {
    this.waitedPatiently = true;
  }
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
// Explicitly manage `this` at call time.
class DelayHandler {
  constructor() {
    // Use anonymous functions if possible.
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.patienceTracker();
    }, 5000);
  }
  private patienceTracker() {
    this.waitedPatiently = true;
  }
}
```

### Event handlers

Event handlers *may* use arrow functions when there is no need to uninstall the handler (for example, if the event is emitted by the class itself). If the handler requires uninstallation, arrow function properties are the right approach, because they automatically capture `this` and provide a stable reference to uninstall.

**Good:**
```ts
// Event handlers may be anonymous functions or arrow function properties.
class Component {
  onAttached() {
    // The event is emitted by this class, no need to uninstall.
    this.addEventListener('click', () => {
      this.listener();
    });
    // this.listener is a stable reference, we can uninstall it later.
    window.addEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener);
  }
  onDetached() {
    // The event is emitted by window. If we don't uninstall, this.listener will
    // keep a reference to `this` because it's bound, causing a memory leak.
    window.removeEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener);
  }
  // An arrow function stored in a property is bound to `this` automatically.
  private listener = () => {
    confirm('Do you want to exit the page?');
  }
}
```

Do not use `bind` in the expression that installs an event handler, because it creates a temporary reference that can't be uninstalled.

**Bad:**
```ts
// Binding listeners creates a temporary reference that prevents uninstalling.
class Component {
  onAttached() {
    // This creates a temporary reference that we won't be able to uninstall
    window.addEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener.bind(this));
  }
  onDetached() {
    // This bind creates a different reference, so this line does nothing.
    window.removeEventListener('onbeforeunload', this.listener.bind(this));
  }
  private listener() {
    confirm('Do you want to exit the page?');
  }
}
```

### Parameter initializers

Optional function parameters *may* be given a default initializer to use when the argument is omitted. Initializers *must not* have any observable side effects. Initializers *should* be kept as simple as possible.

**Good:**
```ts
function process(name: string, extraContext: string[] = []) {}
function activate(index = 0) {}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
// BAD: side effect of incrementing the counter
let globalCounter = 0;
function newId(index = globalCounter++) {}

// BAD: exposes shared mutable state, which can introduce unintended coupling
// between function calls
class Foo {
  private readonly defaultPaths: string[];
  frobnicate(paths = defaultPaths) {}
}
```

Use default parameters sparingly. Prefer destructuring to create readable APIs when there are more than a small handful of optional parameters that do not have a natural order.

### Prefer rest and spread when appropriate

Use a *rest* parameter instead of accessing `arguments`. Never name a local variable or parameter `arguments`, which confusingly shadows the built-in name.

**Good:**
```ts
function variadic(array: string[], ...numbers: number[]) {}
```

Use function spread syntax instead of `Function.prototype.apply`.

### Formatting functions

Blank lines at the start or end of the function body are not allowed.

A single blank line *may* be used within function bodies sparingly to create *logical groupings* of statements.

Generators should attach the `*` to the `function` and `yield` keywords, as in `function* foo()` and `yield* iter`, rather than ~~`function *foo()`~~ or ~~`yield *iter`~~.

Parentheses around the left-hand side of a single-argument arrow function are recommended but not required.

Do not put a space after the `...` in rest or spread syntax.

**Good:**
```ts
function myFunction(...elements: number[]) {}
myFunction(...array, ...iterable, ...generator());
```

## this

Only use `this` in class constructors and methods, functions that have an explicit `this` type declared (e.g. `function func(this: ThisType, ...)`), or in arrow functions defined in a scope where `this` may be used.

Never use `this` to refer to the global object, the context of an `eval`, the target of an event, or unnecessarily `call()`ed or `apply()`ed functions.

**Bad:**
```ts
this.alert('Hello');
```

## Interfaces

## Primitive literals

### String literals

#### Use single quotes

Ordinary string literals are delimited with single quotes (`'`), rather than double quotes (`"`).

Tip: if a string contains a single quote character, consider using a template string to avoid having to escape the quote.

#### No line continuations

Do not use *line continuations* (that is, ending a line inside a string literal with a backslash) in either ordinary or template string literals. Even though ES5 allows this, it can lead to tricky errors if any trailing whitespace comes after the slash, and is less obvious to readers.

Disallowed:

**Bad:**
```ts
const LONG_STRING = 'This is a very very very very very very very long string. \
    It inadvertently contains long stretches of spaces due to how the \
    continued lines are indented.';
```

Instead, write

**Good:**
```ts
const LONG_STRING = 'This is a very very very very very very long string. ' +
    'It does not contain long stretches of spaces because it uses ' +
    'concatenated strings.';
const SINGLE_STRING =
    'http://it.is.also/acceptable_to_use_a_single_long_string_when_breaking_would_hinder_search_discoverability';
```

#### Template literals

Use template literals (delimited with `` ` ``) over complex string concatenation, particularly if multiple string literals are involved. Template literals may span multiple lines.

If a template literal spans multiple lines, it does not need to follow the indentation of the enclosing block, though it may if the added whitespace does not matter.

Example:

**Good:**
```ts
function arithmetic(a: number, b: number) {
  return `Here is a table of arithmetic operations:
${a} + ${b} = ${a + b}
${a} - ${b} = ${a - b}
${a} * ${b} = ${a * b}
${a} / ${b} = ${a / b}`;
}
```

### Number literals

Numbers may be specified in decimal, hex, octal, or binary. Use exactly `0x`, `0o`, and `0b` prefixes, with lowercase letters, for hex, octal, and binary, respectively. Never include a leading zero unless it is immediately followed by `x`, `o`, or `b`.

### Type coercion

TypeScript code *may* use the `String()` and `Boolean()` (note: no `new`!) functions, string template literals, or `!!` to coerce types.

**Good:**
```ts
const bool = Boolean(false);
const str = String(aNumber);
const bool2 = !!str;
const str2 = `result: ${bool2}`;
```

Values of enum types (including unions of enum types and other types) *must not* be converted to booleans with `Boolean()` or `!!`, and must instead be compared explicitly with comparison operators.

**Bad:**
```ts
enum SupportLevel {
  NONE,
  BASIC,
  ADVANCED,
}

const level: SupportLevel = ...;
let enabled = Boolean(level);

const maybeLevel: SupportLevel|undefined = ...;
enabled = !!maybeLevel;
```

**Good:**
```ts
enum SupportLevel {
  NONE,
  BASIC,
  ADVANCED,
}

const level: SupportLevel = ...;
let enabled = level !== SupportLevel.NONE;

const maybeLevel: SupportLevel|undefined = ...;
enabled = level !== undefined && level !== SupportLevel.NONE;
```

**Why?**

For most purposes, it doesn't matter what number or string value an enum name is mapped to at runtime, because values of enum types are referred to by name in source code. Consequently, engineers are accustomed to not thinking about this, and so situations where it *does* matter are undesirable because they will be surprising. Such is the case with conversion of enums to booleans; in particular, by default, the first declared enum value is falsy (because it is 0) while the others are truthy, which is likely to be unexpected. Readers of code that uses an enum value may not even know whether it's the first declared value or not.

Using string concatenation to cast to string is discouraged, as we check that operands to the plus operator are of matching types.

Code *must* use `Number()` to parse numeric values, and *must* check its return for `NaN` values explicitly, unless failing to parse is impossible from context.

Note: `Number('')`, `Number(' ')`, and `Number('\t')` would return `0` instead of `NaN`. `Number('Infinity')` and `Number('-Infinity')` would return `Infinity` and `-Infinity` respectively. Additionally, exponential notation such as `Number('1e+309')` and `Number('-1e+309')` can overflow into `Infinity`. These cases may require special handling.

**Good:**
```ts
const aNumber = Number('123');
if (!isFinite(aNumber)) throw new Error(...);
```

Code *must not* use unary plus (`+`) to coerce strings to numbers. Parsing numbers can fail, has surprising corner cases, and can be a code smell (parsing at the wrong layer). A unary plus is too easy to miss in code reviews given this.

**Bad:**
```ts
const x = +y;
```

Code also *must not* use `parseInt` or `parseFloat` to parse numbers, except for non-base-10 strings (see below). Both of those functions ignore trailing characters in the string, which can shadow error conditions (e.g. parsing `12 dwarves` as `12`).

**Bad:**
```ts
const n = parseInt(someString, 10);  // Error prone,
const f = parseFloat(someString);    // regardless of passing a radix.
```

Code that requires parsing with a radix *must* check that its input contains only appropriate digits for that radix before calling into `parseInt`;

**Good:**
```ts
if (!/^[a-fA-F0-9]+$/.test(someString)) throw new Error(...);
// Needed to parse hexadecimal.
// tslint:disable-next-line:ban
const n = parseInt(someString, 16);  // Only allowed for radix != 10
```

Use `Number()` followed by `Math.floor` or `Math.trunc` (where available) to parse integer numbers:

**Good:**
```ts
let f = Number(someString);
if (isNaN(f)) handleError();
f = Math.floor(f);
```

#### Implicit coercion

Do not use explicit boolean coercions in conditional clauses that have implicit boolean coercion. Those are the conditions in an `if`, `for` and `while` statements.

**Bad:**
```ts
const foo: MyInterface|null = ...;
if (!!foo) {...}
while (!!foo) {...}
```

**Good:**
```ts
const foo: MyInterface|null = ...;
if (foo) {...}
while (foo) {...}
```

As with explicit conversions, values of enum types (including unions of enum types and other types) *must not* be implicitly coerced to booleans, and must instead be compared explicitly with comparison operators.

**Bad:**
```ts
enum SupportLevel {
  NONE,
  BASIC,
  ADVANCED,
}

const level: SupportLevel = ...;
if (level) {...}

const maybeLevel: SupportLevel|undefined = ...;
if (level) {...}
```

**Good:**
```ts
enum SupportLevel {
  NONE,
  BASIC,
  ADVANCED,
}

const level: SupportLevel = ...;
if (level !== SupportLevel.NONE) {...}

const maybeLevel: SupportLevel|undefined = ...;
if (level !== undefined && level !== SupportLevel.NONE) {...}
```

Other types of values may be either implicitly coerced to booleans or compared explicitly with comparison operators:

**Good:**
```ts
// Explicitly comparing > 0 is OK:
if (arr.length > 0) {...}
// so is relying on boolean coercion:
if (arr.length) {...}
```

## Control structures

### Control flow statements and blocks

Control flow statements (`if`, `else`, `for`, `do`, `while`, etc) always use braced blocks for the containing code, even if the body contains only a single statement. The first statement of a non-empty block must begin on its own line.

**Good:**
```ts
for (let i = 0; i < x; i++) {
  doSomethingWith(i);
}

if (x) {
  doSomethingWithALongMethodNameThatForcesANewLine(x);
}
```

**Bad:**
```ts
if (x)
  doSomethingWithALongMethodNameThatForcesANewLine(x);

for (let i = 0; i < x; i++) doSomethingWith(i);
```

**Exception:** `if` statements fitting on one line *may* elide the block.

**Good:**
```ts
if (x) x.doFoo();
```

#### Assignment in control statements

Prefer to avoid assignment of variables inside control statements. Assignment can be easily mistaken for equality checks inside control statements.

**Bad:**
```ts
if (x = someFunction()) {
  // Assignment easily mistaken with equality check
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
x = someFunction();
if (x) {
  // ...
}
```

In cases where assignment inside the control statement is preferred, enclose the assignment in additional parenthesis to indicate it is intentional.

```ts
while ((x = someFunction())) {
  // Double parenthesis shows assignment is intentional
  // ...
}
```

#### Iterating containers

Prefer `for (... of someArr)` to iterate over arrays. `Array.prototype.forEach` and vanilla `for` loops are also allowed:

**Good:**
```ts
for (const x of someArr) {
  // x is a value of someArr.
}

for (let i = 0; i < someArr.length; i++) {
  // Explicitly count if the index is needed, otherwise use the for/of form.
  const x = someArr[i];
  // ...
}
for (const [i, x] of someArr.entries()) {
  // Alternative version of the above.
}
```

`for`-`in` loops may only be used on dict-style objects (see below for more info). Do not use `for (... in ...)` to iterate over arrays as it will counterintuitively give the array's indices (as strings!), not values:

**Bad:**
```ts
for (const x in someArray) {
  // x is the index!
}
```

`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` should be used in `for`-`in` loops to exclude unwanted prototype properties. Prefer `for`-`of` with `Object.keys`, `Object.values`, or `Object.entries` over `for`-`in` when possible.

**Good:**
```ts
for (const key in obj) {
  if (!obj.hasOwnProperty(key)) continue;
  doWork(key, obj[key]);
}
for (const key of Object.keys(obj)) {
  doWork(key, obj[key]);
}
for (const value of Object.values(obj)) {
  doWorkValOnly(value);
}
for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) {
  doWork(key, value);
}
```

### Grouping parentheses

Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when the author and reviewer agree that there is no reasonable chance that the code will be misinterpreted without them, nor would they have made the code easier to read. It is *not* reasonable to assume that every reader has the entire operator precedence table memorized.

Do not use unnecessary parentheses around the entire expression following `delete`, `typeof`, `void`, `return`, `throw`, `case`, `in`, `of`, or `yield`.

### Exception handling

Exceptions are an important part of the language and should be used whenever exceptional cases occur.

Custom exceptions provide a great way to convey additional error information from functions. They should be defined and used wherever the native `Error` type is insufficient.

Prefer throwing exceptions over ad-hoc error-handling approaches (such as passing an error container reference type, or returning an object with an error property).

#### Instantiate errors using `new`

Always use `new Error()` when instantiating exceptions, instead of just calling `Error()`. Both forms create a new `Error` instance, but using `new` is more consistent with how other objects are instantiated.

**Good:**
```ts
throw new Error('Foo is not a valid bar.');
```

**Bad:**
```ts
throw Error('Foo is not a valid bar.');
```

#### Only throw errors

JavaScript (and thus TypeScript) allow throwing or rejecting a Promise with arbitrary values. However if the thrown or rejected value is not an `Error`, it does not populate stack trace information, making debugging hard. This treatment extends to `Promise` rejection values as `Promise.reject(obj)` is equivalent to `throw obj;` in async functions.

**Bad:**
```ts
// bad: does not get a stack trace.
throw 'oh noes!';
// For promises
new Promise((resolve, reject) => void reject('oh noes!'));
Promise.reject();
Promise.reject('oh noes!');
```

Instead, only throw (subclasses of) `Error`:

**Good:**
```ts
// Throw only Errors
throw new Error('oh noes!');
// ... or subtypes of Error.
class MyError extends Error {}
throw new MyError('my oh noes!');
// For promises
new Promise((resolve) => resolve()); // No reject is OK.
new Promise((resolve, reject) => void reject(new Error('oh noes!')));
Promise.reject(new Error('oh noes!'));
```

#### Catching and rethrowing

When catching errors, code *should* assume that all thrown errors are instances of `Error`.

**Good:**
```ts
function assertIsError(e: unknown): asserts e is Error {
  if (!(e instanceof Error)) throw new Error("e is not an Error");
}

try {
  doSomething();
} catch (e: unknown) {
  // All thrown errors must be Error subtypes. Do not handle
  // other possible values unless you know they are thrown.
  assertIsError(e);
  displayError(e.message);
  // or rethrow:
  throw e;
}
```

Exception handlers *must not* defensively handle non-`Error` types unless the called API is conclusively known to throw non-`Error`s in violation of the above rule. In that case, a comment should be included to specifically identify where the non-`Error`s originate.

**Good:**
```ts
try {
  badApiThrowingStrings();
} catch (e: unknown) {
  // Note: bad API throws strings instead of errors.
  if (typeof e === 'string') { ... }
}
```

**Why?**

Avoid [overly defensive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defensive_programming#Offensive_programming). Repeating the same defenses against a problem that will not exist in most code leads to boiler-plate code that is not useful.

#### Empty catch blocks

It is very rarely correct to do nothing in response to a caught exception. When it truly is appropriate to take no action whatsoever in a catch block, the reason this is justified is explained in a comment.

**Good:**
```ts
  try {
    return handleNumericResponse(response);
  } catch (e: unknown) {
    // Response is not numeric. Continue to handle as text.
  }
  return handleTextResponse(response);
```

Disallowed:

**Bad:**
```ts
  try {
    shouldFail();
    fail('expected an error');
  } catch (expected: unknown) {
  }
```

Tip: Unlike in some other languages, patterns like the above simply don’t work since this will catch the error thrown by `fail`. Use `assertThrows()` instead.

### Switch statements

All `switch` statements *must* contain a `default` statement group, even if it contains no code. The `default` statement group must be last.

**Good:**
```ts
switch (x) {
  case Y:
    doSomethingElse();
    break;
  default:
    // nothing to do.
}
```

Within a switch block, each statement group either terminates abruptly with a `break`, a `return` statement, or by throwing an exception. Non-empty statement groups (`case ...`) *must not* fall through (enforced by the compiler):

**Bad:**
```ts
switch (x) {
  case X:
    doSomething();
    // fall through - not allowed!
  case Y:
    // ...
}
```

Empty statement groups are allowed to fall through:

**Good:**
```ts
switch (x) {
  case X:
  case Y:
    doSomething();
    break;
  default: // nothing to do.
}
```

### Equality checks

Always use triple equals (`===`) and not equals (`!==`). The double equality operators cause error prone type coercions that are hard to understand and slower to implement for JavaScript Virtual Machines. See also the [JavaScript equality table](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/).

**Bad:**
```ts
if (foo == 'bar' || baz != bam) {
  // Hard to understand behaviour due to type coercion.
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
if (foo === 'bar' || baz !== bam) {
  // All good here.
}
```

**Exception:** Comparisons to the literal `null` value *may* use the `==` and `!=` operators to cover both `null` and `undefined` values.

**Good:**
```ts
if (foo == null) {
  // Will trigger when foo is null or undefined.
}
```

### Type and non-nullability assertions

Type assertions (`x as SomeType`) and non-nullability assertions (`y!`) are unsafe. Both only silence the TypeScript compiler, but do not insert any runtime checks to match these assertions, so they can cause your program to crash at runtime.

Because of this, you *should not* use type and non-nullability assertions without an obvious or explicit reason for doing so.

Instead of the following:

**Bad:**
```ts
(x as Foo).foo();

y!.bar();
```

When you want to assert a type or non-nullability the best answer is to explicitly write a runtime check that performs that check.

**Good:**
```ts
// assuming Foo is a class.
if (x instanceof Foo) {
  x.foo();
}

if (y) {
  y.bar();
}
```

Sometimes due to some local property of your code you can be sure that the assertion form is safe. In those situations, you *should* add clarification to explain why you are ok with the unsafe behavior:

**Good:**
```ts
// x is a Foo, because ...
(x as Foo).foo();

// y cannot be null, because ...
y!.bar();
```

If the reasoning behind a type or non-nullability assertion is obvious, the comments *may* not be necessary. For example, generated proto code is always nullable, but perhaps it is well-known in the context of the code that certain fields are always provided by the backend. Use your judgement.

#### Type assertion syntax

Type assertions *must* use the `as` syntax (as opposed to the angle brackets syntax). This enforces parentheses around the assertion when accessing a member.

**Bad:**
```ts
const x = (<Foo>z).length;
const y = <Foo>z.length;
```

**Good:**
```ts
// z must be Foo because ...
const x = (z as Foo).length;
```

#### Double assertions

From the [TypeScript handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#type-assertions), TypeScript only allows type assertions which convert to a *more specific* or *less specific* version of a type. Adding a type assertion (`x as Foo`) which does not meet this criteria will give the error: “Conversion of type 'X' to type 'Y' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other.”

If you are sure an assertion is safe, you can perform a *double assertion*. This involves casting through `unknown` since it is less specific than all types.

**Good:**
```ts
// x is a Foo here, because...
(x as unknown as Foo).fooMethod();
```

Use `unknown` (instead of `any` or `{}`) as the intermediate type.

#### Type assertions and object literals

Use type annotations (`: Foo`) instead of type assertions (`as Foo`) to specify the type of an object literal. This allows detecting refactoring bugs when the fields of an interface change over time.

**Bad:**
```ts
interface Foo {
  bar: number;
  baz?: string;  // was "bam", but later renamed to "baz".
}

const foo = {
  bar: 123,
  bam: 'abc',  // no error!
} as Foo;

function func() {
  return {
    bar: 123,
    bam: 'abc',  // no error!
  } as Foo;
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
interface Foo {
  bar: number;
  baz?: string;
}

const foo: Foo = {
  bar: 123,
  bam: 'abc',  // complains about "bam" not being defined on Foo.
};

function func(): Foo {
  return {
    bar: 123,
    bam: 'abc',   // complains about "bam" not being defined on Foo.
  };
}
```

### Keep try blocks focused

Limit the amount of code inside a try block, if this can be done without hurting readability.

**Bad:**
```ts
try {
  const result = methodThatMayThrow();
  use(result);
} catch (error: unknown) {
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**
```ts
let result;
try {
  result = methodThatMayThrow();
} catch (error: unknown) {
  // ...
}
use(result);
```

Moving the non-throwable lines out of the try/catch block helps the reader learn which method throws exceptions. Some inline calls that do not throw exceptions could stay inside because they might not be worth the extra complication of a temporary variable.

**Exception:** There may be performance issues if try blocks are inside a loop. Widening try blocks to cover a whole loop is ok.

## Decorators

Decorators are syntax with an `@` prefix, like `@MyDecorator`.

Do not define new decorators. Only use the decorators defined by frameworks:

- Angular (e.g. `@Component`, `@NgModule`, etc.)

- Polymer (e.g. `@property`)

Why?

We generally want to avoid decorators, because they were an experimental feature that have since diverged from the TC39 proposal and have known bugs that won't be fixed.

When using decorators, the decorator *must* immediately precede the symbol it decorates, with no empty lines between:

```ts
/** JSDoc comments go before decorators */
@Component({...})  // Note: no empty line after the decorator.
class MyComp {
  @Input() myField: string;  // Decorators on fields may be on the same line...

  @Input()
  myOtherField: string;  // ... or wrap.
}
```

## Disallowed features

### Wrapper objects for primitive types

TypeScript code *must not* instantiate the wrapper classes for the primitive types `String`, `Boolean`, and `Number`. Wrapper classes have surprising behavior, such as `new Boolean(false)` evaluating to `true`.

**Bad:**
```ts
const s = new String('hello');
const b = new Boolean(false);
const n = new Number(5);
```

The wrappers may be called as functions for coercing (which is preferred over using `+` or concatenating the empty string) or creating symbols. See type coercion for more information.

### Automatic Semicolon Insertion

Do not rely on Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI). Explicitly end all statements using a semicolon. This prevents bugs due to incorrect semicolon insertions and ensures compatibility with tools with limited ASI support (e.g. clang-format).

### Const enums

Code *must not* use `const enum`; use plain `enum` instead.

**Why?**

TypeScript enums already cannot be mutated; `const enum` is a separate language feature related to optimization that makes the enum invisible to JavaScript users of the module.

### Debugger statements

Debugger statements *must not* be included in production code.

**Bad:**
```ts
function debugMe() {
  debugger;
}
```

### `with`

Do not use the `with` keyword. It makes your code harder to understand and [has been banned in strict mode since ES5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with).

### Dynamic code evaluation

Do not use `eval` or the `Function(...string)` constructor (except for code loaders). These features are potentially dangerous and simply do not work in environments using strict [Content Security Policies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP).

### Non-standard features

Do not use non-standard ECMAScript or Web Platform features.

This includes:

- Old features that have been marked deprecated or removed entirely from ECMAScript / the Web Platform (see [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Deprecated_and_obsolete_features))

- New ECMAScript features that are not yet standardized
  - Avoid using features that are in current TC39 working draft or currently in the [proposal process](https://tc39.es/process-document/)
  
  - Use only ECMAScript features defined in the current ECMA-262 specification

- Proposed but not-yet-complete web standards:
  - WHATWG proposals that have not completed the [proposal process](https://whatwg.org/faq#adding-new-features).

- Non-standard language “extensions” (such as those provided by some external transpilers)

Projects targeting specific JavaScript runtimes, such as latest-Chrome-only, Chrome extensions, Node.JS, Electron, can obviously use those APIs. Use caution when considering an API surface that is proprietary and only implemented in some browsers; consider whether there is a common library that can abstract this API surface away for you.

### Modifying builtin objects

Never modify builtin types, either by adding methods to their constructors or to their prototypes. Avoid depending on libraries that do this.

Do not add symbols to the global object unless absolutely necessary (e.g. required by a third-party API).

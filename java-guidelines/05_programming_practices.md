# 6 Programming Practices

## 6.1 `@Override`: always used

A method is marked with the `@Override` annotation whenever it is legal. This includes a class method overriding a superclass method, a class method implementing an interface method, an interface method respecifying a superinterface method, and an explicitly declared accessor method for a record component.

> **Exception:** `@Override` may be omitted when the parent method is `@Deprecated`.

## 6.2 Caught exceptions: not ignored

It is very rarely correct to do nothing in response to a caught exception. (Typical responses are to log it, or if it is considered "impossible", rethrow it as an `AssertionError`.)

When it truly is appropriate to take no action whatsoever in a catch block, the reason this is justified is explained in a comment.

```java
try {
  int i = Integer.parseInt(response);
  return handleNumericResponse(i);
} catch (NumberFormatException _) {
  // it's not numeric; that's fine, just continue
}
return handleTextResponse(response);
```

## 6.3 Static members: qualified using class

When a reference to a static class member must be qualified, it is qualified with that class's name, not with a reference or expression of that class's type.

```java
Foo aFoo = ...;
Foo.aStaticMethod(); // good
aFoo.aStaticMethod(); // bad
somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod(); // very bad
```

## 6.4 Finalizers: not used

Do not override `Object.finalize`. Finalization support is [*scheduled for removal*](https://openjdk.org/jeps/421).

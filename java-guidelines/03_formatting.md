# 4 Formatting

> **Terminology Note:** *block-like construct* refers to the body of a class, method, constructor, or switch. Note that, by Section 4.8.3.1 on array initializers, any array initializer *may* optionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.

## 4.1 Braces

### 4.1.1 Use of optional braces

Braces are used with `if`, `else`, `for`, `do` and `while` statements, even when the body is empty or contains only a single statement.

Other optional braces, such as those in a lambda expression, remain optional.

### 4.1.2 Nonempty blocks: K & R style

Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style for *nonempty* blocks and block-like constructs:

- No line break before the opening brace, except as detailed below.
- Line break after the opening brace.
- Line break before the closing brace.
- Line break after the closing brace, *only if* that brace terminates a statement or terminates the body of a method, constructor, or *named* class. For example, there is *no* line break after the brace if it is followed by `else` or a comma.

Exception: In places where these rules allow a single statement ending with a semicolon (`;`), a block of statements can appear, and the opening brace of this block is preceded by a line break. Blocks like these are typically introduced to limit the scope of local variables.

Examples:

```java
return () -> {
  while (condition()) {
    method();
  }
};

return new MyClass() {
  @Override public void method() {
    if (condition()) {
      try {
        something();
      } catch (ProblemException e) {
        recover();
      }
    } else if (otherCondition()) {
      somethingElse();
    } else {
      lastThing();
    }
    {
      int x = foo();
      frob(x);
    }
  }
};
```

A few exceptions for enum classes are given in Section 4.8.1, Enum classes.

### 4.1.3 Empty blocks: may be concise

An empty block or block-like construct may be in K & R style (as described in Section 4.1.2). Alternatively, it may be closed immediately after it is opened, with no characters or line break in between (`{}`), **unless** it is part of a *multi-block statement* (one that directly contains multiple blocks: `if/else` or `try/catch/finally`).

Examples:

```java
  // This is acceptable
  void doNothing() {}

  // This is equally acceptable
  void doNothingElse() {
  }
```

**Bad:**
```java
  // This is not acceptable: No concise empty blocks in a multi-block statement
  try {
    doSomething();
  } catch (Exception e) {}
```

## 4.2 Block indentation: +2 spaces

Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level applies to both code and comments throughout the block. (See the example in Section 4.1.2, Nonempty blocks: K & R Style.)

## 4.3 One statement per line

Each statement is followed by a line break.

## 4.4 Column limit: 100

Java code has a column limit of 100 characters. A "character" means any Unicode code point. Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained in Section 4.5, Line-wrapping.

> Each Unicode code point counts as one character, even if its display width is greater or less. For example, if using [fullwidth characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms), you may choose to wrap the line earlier than where this rule strictly requires.

**Exceptions:**

1. Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL in Javadoc, or a long JSNI method reference).
2. `package` declarations and imports (see Sections 3.2 Package declarations and 3.3 Imports).
3. Contents of text blocks.
4. Command lines in a comment that may be copied-and-pasted into a shell.
5. Very long identifiers, on the rare occasions they are called for, are allowed to exceed the column limit. In that case, the valid wrapping for the surrounding code is as produced by [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format).

## 4.5 Line-wrapping

> **Terminology Note:** When code that might otherwise occupy a single line is divided into multiple lines, this activity is called *line-wrapping*.

There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showing *exactly* how to line-wrap in every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to line-wrap the same piece of code.

> **Note:** While the typical reason for line-wrapping is to avoid overflowing the column limit, even code that would in fact fit within the column limit *may* be line-wrapped at the author's discretion.

> **Tip:** Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem without the need to line-wrap.

### 4.5.1 Where to break

The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a **higher syntactic level**. Also:

1. When a line is broken at a *non-assignment* operator the break comes *before* the symbol. (Note that this is not the same practice used in Google style for other languages, such as C++ and JavaScript.)
   - This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:
     - the dot separator (`.`)
     - the two colons of a method reference (`::`)
     - an ampersand in a type bound (`<T extends Foo & Bar>`)
     - a pipe in a catch block (`catch (FooException | BarException e)`).
2. When a line is broken at an *assignment* operator the break typically comes *after* the symbol, but either way is acceptable.
   - This also applies to the colon in an enhanced `for` ("foreach") statement.
3. A method, constructor, or record-class name stays attached to the open parenthesis (`(`) that follows it.
4. A comma (`,`) stays attached to the token that precedes it.
5. A line is never broken adjacent to the arrow in a lambda or a switch rule, except that a break may come immediately after the arrow if the text following it consists of a single unbraced expression. Examples:
   ```java
   MyLambda<String, Long, Object> lambda =
       (String label, Long value, Object obj) -> {
         ...
       };
   
   Predicate<String> predicate = str ->
       longExpressionInvolving(str);
   
   switch (x) {
     case ColorPoint(Color color, Point(int x, int y)) ->
         handleColorPoint(color, x, y);
     ...
   }
   ```

> **Note:** The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear code, *not necessarily* code that fits in the smallest number of lines.

### 4.5.2 Indent continuation lines at least +4 spaces

When line-wrapping, each line after the first (each *continuation line*) is indented at least +4 from the original line.

When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +4 as desired. In general, two continuation lines use the same indentation level if and only if they begin with syntactically parallel elements.

Section 4.6.3 on Horizontal alignment addresses the discouraged practice of using a variable number of spaces to align certain tokens with previous lines.

## 4.6 Whitespace

### 4.6.1 Vertical whitespace (blank lines)

A single blank line always appears:

1. *Between* consecutive members or initializers of a class: fields, constructors, methods, nested classes, static initializers, and instance initializers.
   - **Exception:** A blank line between two consecutive fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to create *logical groupings* of fields.
   - **Exception:** Blank lines between enum constants are covered in Section 4.8.1.
2. As required by other sections of this document (such as Section 3, Source file structure, and Section 3.3, Imports).

A single blank line may also appear anywhere it improves readability, for example between statements to organize the code into logical subsections. A blank line before the first member or initializer, or after the last member or initializer of the class, is neither encouraged nor discouraged.

*Multiple* consecutive blank lines are permitted, but never required (or encouraged).

### 4.6.2 Horizontal whitespace

Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from within literals, comments and Javadoc, a single ASCII space also appears in the following places **only**.

1. Separating any keyword, such as `if`, `for` or `catch`, from an open parenthesis (`(`) that follows it on that line
2. Separating any keyword, such as `else` or `catch`, from a closing curly brace (`}`) that precedes it on that line
3. Before any open curly brace (`{`), with two exceptions:
   - `@SomeAnnotation({a, b})` (no space is used)
   - `String[][] x = {{"foo"}};` (no space is required between `{{`, by item 10 below)
4. On both sides of any binary or ternary operator. This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:
   - the ampersand that separates multiple type bounds: `<T extends Foo & Bar>`
   - the pipe for a catch block that handles multiple exceptions: `catch (FooException | BarException e)`
   - the colon (`:`) in an enhanced `for` ("foreach") statement
   - the arrow in a lambda expression: `(String str) -> str.length()`
      or switch rule: `case "FOO" -> bar();`
   but not
   - the two colons (`::`) of a method reference, which is written like `Object::toString`
   - the dot separator (`.`), which is written like `object.toString()`
5. After `,:;` or the closing parenthesis (`)`) of a cast
6. Between any content and a double slash (`//`) which begins a comment. Multiple spaces are allowed.
7. Between a double slash (`//`) which begins a comment and the comment's text. Multiple spaces are allowed.
8. Between the type and identifier of a declaration: `List<String> list`
9. *Optional* just inside both braces of an array initializer
   - `new int[] {5, 6}` and `new int[] { 5, 6 }` are both valid
10. Between a type annotation and `[]` or `...`.

This rule is never interpreted as requiring or forbidding additional space at the start or end of a line; it addresses only *interior* space.

### 4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: never required

> **Terminology Note:** *Horizontal alignment* is the practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.

This practice is permitted, but is **never required** by Google Style. It is not even required to *maintain* horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.

Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:

```java
private int x; // this is fine
private Color color; // this too

private int   x;      // permitted, but future edits
private Color color;  // may leave it unaligned
```

> **Tip:** Alignment can aid readability, but attempting to preserve alignment for its own sake creates future problems. For example, consider a change that touches only one line. If that change disrupts the previous alignment, it's important **not** to introduce additional changes on nearby lines simply to realign them. Introducing formatting changes on otherwise unaffected lines corrupts version history, slows down reviewers, and exacerbates merge conflicts. These practical concerns take priority over alignment.

## 4.7 Grouping parentheses: recommended

Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when author and reviewer agree that there is no reasonable chance the code will be misinterpreted without them, nor would they have made the code easier to read. It is *not* reasonable to assume that every reader has the entire Java operator precedence table memorized.

## 4.8 Specific constructs

### 4.8.1 Enum classes

After the comma that follows an enum constant, a line break is optional. Additional blank lines (usually just one) are also allowed. This is one possibility:

```java
private enum Answer {
  YES {
    @Override public String toString() {
      return "yes";
    }
  },

  NO,
  MAYBE
}
```

An enum class with no methods and no documentation on its constants may optionally be formatted as if it were an array initializer (see Section 4.8.3.1 on array initializers).

```java
private enum Suit { CLUBS, HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS }
```

Since enum classes *are classes*, all other rules for formatting classes apply.

### 4.8.2 Variable declarations

#### 4.8.2.1 One variable per declaration

Every variable declaration (field or local) declares only one variable: declarations such as ~~`int a, b;`~~ are not used.

**Exception:** Multiple variable declarations are acceptable in the header of a `for` loop.

#### 4.8.2.2 Declared when needed

Local variables are **not** habitually declared at the start of their containing block or block-like construct. Instead, local variables are declared close to the point they are first used (within reason), to minimize their scope. Local variable declarations typically have initializers, or are initialized immediately after declaration.

### 4.8.3 Arrays

#### 4.8.3.1 Array initializers: can be "block-like"

Any array initializer may *optionally* be formatted as if it were a "block-like construct." For example, the following are all valid (**not** an exhaustive list):

```java
new int[] {           new int[] {
  0, 1, 2, 3            0,
}                       1,
                        2,
new int[] {             3,
  0, 1,               }
  2, 3
}                     new int[]
                          {0, 1, 2, 3}
```

#### 4.8.3.2 No C-style array declarations

The square brackets form a part of the *type*, not the variable: `String[] args`, not ~~`String args[]`~~.

### 4.8.4 Switch statements and expressions

For historical reasons, the Java language has two distinct syntaxes for `switch`, which we can call *old-style* and *new-style*. New-style switches use an arrow (`->`) after the switch labels, while old-style switches use a colon (`:`).

> **Terminology Note:** Inside the braces of a *switch block* are either one or more *switch rules* (new-style); or one or more *statement groups* (old-style). A *switch rule* consists of a *switch label* (`case ...` or `default`) followed by `->` and an expression, block, or `throw`. A statement group consists of one or more switch labels each followed by a colon, then one or more statements, or, for the *last* statement group, *zero* or more statements. (These definitions match the Java Language Specification, [§14.11](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se21/html/jls-14.html#jls-14.11).)

#### 4.8.4.1 Indentation

As with any other block, the contents of a switch block are indented +2. Each switch label starts with this +2 indentation.

In a new-style switch, a switch rule can be written on a single line if it otherwise follows Google style. (It must not exceed the column limit, and if it contains a non-empty block then there must be a line break after `{`.) The line-wrapping rules of Section 4.5 apply, including the +4 indent for continuation lines. For a switch rule with a non-empty block after the arrow, the same rules apply as for blocks elsewhere: lines between `{` and `}` are indented a further +2 relative to the line with the switch label.

```java
switch (number) {
  case 0, 1 -> handleZeroOrOne();
  case 2 ->
      handleTwoWithAnExtremelyLongMethodCallThatWouldNotFitOnTheSameLine();
  default -> {
    logger.atInfo().log("Surprising number %s", number);
    handleSurprisingNumber(number);
  }
}
```

In an old-style switch, the colon of each switch label is followed by a line break. The statements within a statement group are indented a further +2.

#### 4.8.4.2 Fall-through: commented

Within an old-style switch block, each statement group either terminates abruptly (with a `break`, `continue`, `return` or thrown exception), or is marked with a comment to indicate that execution will or *might* continue into the next statement group. Any comment that communicates the idea of fall-through is sufficient (typically `// fall through`). This special comment is not required in the last statement group of the switch block. Example:

```java
switch (input) {
  case 1:
  case 2:
    prepareOneOrTwo();
  // fall through
  case 3:
    handleOneTwoOrThree();
    break;
  default:
    handleLargeNumber(input);
}
```

Notice that no comment is needed after `case 1:`, only at the end of the statement group.

There is no fall-through in new-style switches.

#### 4.8.4.3 Exhaustiveness and presence of the `default` label

The Java language requires switch expressions and many kinds of switch statements to be *exhaustive*. That effectively means that every possible value that could be switched on will be matched by one of the switch labels. A switch is exhaustive if it has a `default` label, but also for example if the value being switched on is an enum and every value of the enum is matched by a switch label. Google Style requires *every* switch to be exhaustive, even those where the language itself does not require it. This may require adding a `default` label, even if it contains no code.

#### 4.8.4.4 Switch expressions

Switch expressions must be new-style switches:

```java
  return switch (list.size()) {
    case 0 -> "";
    case 1 -> list.getFirst();
    default -> String.join(", ", list);
  };
```

### 4.8.5 Annotations

#### 4.8.5.1 Type-use annotations

Type-use annotations appear immediately before the annotated type. An annotation is a type-use annotation if it is meta-annotated with `@Target(ElementType.TYPE_USE)`. Example:

```java
final @Nullable String name;

public @Nullable Person getPersonByName(String name);
```

#### 4.8.5.2 Class, package, and module annotations

Annotations applying to a class, package, or module declaration appear immediately after the documentation block, and each annotation is listed on a line of its own (that is, one annotation per line). These line breaks do not constitute line-wrapping (Section 4.5, Line-wrapping), so the indentation level is not increased. Examples:

```java
/// This is a class.
@Deprecated
@CheckReturnValue
public final class Frozzler { ... }
```

```java
/// This is a package.
@Deprecated
@CheckReturnValue
package com.example.frozzler;
```

```java
/// This is a module.
@Deprecated
@SuppressWarnings("CheckReturnValue") // TODO(b/123): Fix existing CRV violations.
module com.example.frozzler { ... }
```

#### 4.8.5.3 Method and constructor annotations

The rules for annotations on method and constructor declarations are the same as the previous section. Example:

```java
@Deprecated
@Override
public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }
```

> **Exception:** If the method or constructor only has a *single*, *parameterless* annotation, it *may* appear together with the first line of the signature, for example:

```java
@Override public int hashCode() { ... }
```

#### 4.8.5.4 Field annotations

Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block, but in this case, *multiple* annotations (possibly parameterized) may be listed on the same line; for example:

```java
@Partial @Mock DataLoader loader;
```

#### 4.8.5.5 Parameter and local variable annotations

There are no specific rules for formatting annotations on parameters or local variables (except, of course, when the annotation is a type-use annotation).

### 4.8.6 Comments

This section addresses *implementation comments*. Javadoc is addressed separately in Section 7, Javadoc.

Any line break may be preceded by arbitrary whitespace followed by an implementation comment. Such a comment renders the line non-blank.

#### 4.8.6.1 Block comment style

Block comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code. They may be in `/* ... */` style or `// ...` style. For multi-line `/* ... */` comments, subsequent lines must start with `*` aligned with the `*` on the previous line.

```java
/*
 * This is          // And so           /* Or you can
 * okay.            // is this.          * even do this. */
 */
```

Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.

> **Tip:** When writing multi-line comments, use the `/* ... */` style if you want automatic code formatters to re-wrap the lines when necessary (paragraph-style). Most formatters don't re-wrap lines in `// ...` style comment blocks.

#### 4.8.6.2 TODO comments

Use `TODO` comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or good-enough but not perfect.

A `TODO` comment begins with the word `TODO` in all caps, a following colon, and a link to a resource that contains the context, ideally a bug reference. A bug reference is preferable because bugs are tracked and have follow-up comments. Follow this piece of context with an explanatory string introduced with a hyphen `-`.

The purpose is to have a consistent `TODO` format that can be searched to find out how to get more details.

**Good:**
```
// TODO: crbug.com/12345678 - Remove this after the 2047q4 compatibility window expires.
```

Avoid adding TODOs that refer to an individual or team as the context:

**Bad:**
```
// TODO: @yourusername - File an issue and use a '*' for repetition.
```

If your `TODO` is of the form "At a future date do something" make sure that you either include a very specific date ("Fix by November 2005") or a very specific event ("Remove this code when all clients can handle XML responses.").

### 4.8.7 Modifiers

Class and member modifiers, when present, appear in the order recommended by the Java Language Specification:

```
public protected private abstract default static final sealed non-sealed
  transient volatile synchronized native strictfp
```

Modifiers on `requires` module directives, when present, appear in the following order:

```
transitive static
```

### 4.8.8 Numeric Literals

`long`-valued integer literals use an uppercase `L` suffix, never lowercase (to avoid confusion with the digit `1`). For example, `3000000000L` rather than ~~`3000000000l`~~.

### 4.8.9 Text Blocks

The opening `"""` of a text block is always on a new line. That line may either follow the same indentation rules as other constructs, or it may have no indentation at all (so it starts at the left margin). The closing `"""` is on a new line with the same indentation as the opening `"""`, and may be followed on the same line by further code. Each line of text in the text block is indented at least as much as the opening and closing `"""`. (If a line is indented further, then the string literal defined by the text block will have space at the start of that line.)

The contents of a text block may exceed the column limit.

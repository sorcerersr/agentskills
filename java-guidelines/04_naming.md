# 5 Naming

## 5.1 Rules common to all identifiers

Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases noted below, underscores. Thus each valid identifier name is matched by the regular expression `\w+` .

In Google Style, special prefixes or suffixes are **not** used. For example, these names are not Google Style: ~~`name_`~~, ~~`mName`~~, ~~`s_name`~~ and ~~`kName`~~.

## 5.2 Rules by identifier type

### 5.2.1 Package and module names

Package and module names use only lowercase letters and digits (no underscores). Consecutive words are simply concatenated together. For example, `com.example.deepspace`, not ~~`com.example.deepSpace`~~ or ~~`com.example.deep_space`~~.

### 5.2.2 Class names

Class names are written in UpperCamelCase.

Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, `Character` or `ImmutableList`. Interface names may also be nouns or noun phrases (for example, `List`), but may sometimes be adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example, `Readable`).

There are no specific rules or even well-established conventions for naming annotation types.

A *test* class has a name that ends with `Test`, for example, `HashIntegrationTest`. If it covers a single class, its name is the name of that class plus `Test`, for example `HashImplTest`.

### 5.2.3 Method names

Method names are written in lowerCamelCase.

Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example, `sendMessage` or `stop`.

Underscores may appear in JUnit *test* method names to separate logical components of the name, with *each* component written in lowerCamelCase, for example `transferMoney_deductsFromSource`. There is no One Correct Way to name test methods.

### 5.2.4 Constant names

Constant names use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`: all uppercase letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore. But what *is* a constant, exactly?

Constants are static final fields whose contents are deeply immutable and whose methods have no detectable side effects. Examples include primitives, strings, immutable value classes, and anything set to `null`. If any of the instance's observable state can change, it is not a constant. Merely *intending* to never mutate the object is not enough. Examples:

```java
// Constants
static final int NUMBER = 5;
static final ImmutableList<String> NAMES = ImmutableList.of("Ed", "Ann");
static final Map<String, Integer> AGES = ImmutableMap.of("Ed", 35, "Ann", 32);
static final Joiner COMMA_JOINER = Joiner.on(','); // because Joiner is immutable
static final SomeMutableType[] EMPTY_ARRAY = {};

// Not constants
static String nonFinal = "non-final";
final String nonStatic = "non-static";
static final Set<String> mutableCollection = new HashSet<String>();
static final ImmutableSet<SomeMutableType> mutableElements = ImmutableSet.of(mutable);
static final ImmutableMap<String, SomeMutableType> mutableValues =
    ImmutableMap.of("Ed", mutableInstance, "Ann", mutableInstance2);
static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(MyClass.getName());
static final String[] nonEmptyArray = {"these", "can", "change"};
```

These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.

### 5.2.5 Non-constant field names

Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written in lowerCamelCase.

These names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example, `computedValues` or `index`.

### 5.2.6 Parameter names

Parameter names are written in lowerCamelCase.

One-character parameter names in public methods should be avoided.

### 5.2.7 Local variable names

Local variable names are written in lowerCamelCase.

Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not be styled as constants.

### 5.2.8 Type variable names

Each type variable is named in one of two styles:

- A single capital letter, optionally followed by a single numeral (such as `E`, `T`, `X`, `T2`)
- A name in the form used for classes (see Section 5.2.2, Class names), followed by the capital letter `T` (examples: `RequestT`, `FooBarT`).

### 5.2.9 Unnamed variables

The `_` syntax for unnamed variables and parameters is allowed wherever it is applicable. For example:

```java
Predicate<String> alwaysTrue = _ -> true;
```

## 5.3 Camel case: defined

Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case, such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like "IPv6" or "iOS" are present. To improve predictability, Google Style specifies the following (nearly) deterministic scheme.

Beginning with the prose form of the name:

1. Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, "Müller's algorithm" might become "Muellers algorithm".
2. Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically hyphens).
   - *Recommended:* if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad words"). Note that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel case *per se*; it defies *any* convention, so this recommendation does not apply.
3. Now lowercase *everything* (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first character of:
   - ... each word, to yield *upper camel case*, or
   - ... each word except the first, to yield *lower camel case*
4. Finally, join all the words into a single identifier. Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded.

In very rare circumstances (for example, multipart version numbers), you may need to use underscores to separate adjacent numbers, since numbers do not have upper and lower case variants.

Examples:

| Prose form | Correct | Incorrect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "XML HTTP request" | `XmlHttpRequest` | ~~`XMLHTTPRequest`~~ |
| "new customer ID" | `newCustomerId` | ~~`newCustomerID`~~ |
| "inner stopwatch" | `innerStopwatch` | ~~`innerStopWatch`~~ |
| "supports IPv6 on iOS?" | `supportsIpv6OnIos` | ~~`supportsIPv6OnIOS`~~ |
| "YouTube importer" | `YouTubeImporter`<br> `YoutubeImporter`* |  |
| "Turn on 2SV" | `turnOn2sv` | ~~`turnOn2Sv`~~ |
| "Guava 33.4.6" | `guava33_4_6` | ~~`guava3346`~~ |

*Acceptable, but not recommended.

> **Note:** Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English language: for example "nonempty" and "non-empty" are both correct, so the method names `checkNonempty` and `checkNonEmpty` are likewise both correct.

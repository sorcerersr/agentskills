# 2 Source file basics

## 2.1 File name

For a source file containing classes, the file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class (of which there is exactly one), plus the `.java` extension.

## 2.2 File encoding: UTF-8

Source files are encoded in **UTF-8**.

## 2.3 Special characters

### 2.3.1 Whitespace characters

Aside from the line terminator sequence, the **ASCII horizontal space character** (**0x20**) is the only whitespace character that appears anywhere in a source file. This implies that:

1. All other whitespace characters are escaped in `char` and string literals and in text blocks.
2. Tab characters are **not** used for indentation.

### 2.3.2 Special escape sequences

For any character that has a [special escape sequence](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html) (`\b`, `\t`, `\n`, `\f`, `\r`, `\s`, `\"`, `\'` and `\\`), that sequence is used rather than the corresponding octal (e.g. ~~`\012`~~) or Unicode (e.g. ~~`\u000a`~~) escape.

### 2.3.3 Non-ASCII characters

For the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character (e.g. `∞`) or the equivalent Unicode escape (e.g. `\u221e`) is used. The choice depends only on which makes the code **easier to read and understand**, although Unicode escapes outside string literals and comments are strongly discouraged.

> **Tip:** In the Unicode escape case, and occasionally even when actual Unicode characters are used, an explanatory comment can be very helpful.

Examples:

| Example | Discussion |
| --- | --- |
| `String unitAbbrev = "μs";` | Best: perfectly clear even without a comment. |
| `String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs"; // "μs"` | Allowed, but there's no reason to do this. |
| `String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs"; // Greek letter mu, "s"` | Allowed, but awkward and prone to mistakes. |
| ~~`String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs";`~~ | Poor: the reader has no idea what this is. |
| `return '\ufeff' + content; // byte order mark` | Good: use escapes for non-printable characters, and comment if necessary. |

> **Tip:** Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that some programs might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that should happen, those programs are **broken** and they must be **fixed**.

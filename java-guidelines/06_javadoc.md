# 7 Javadoc

## 7.1 Formatting

### 7.1.1 General form

Both Markdown Javadoc and Traditional Javadoc are acceptable. Markdown Javadoc looks like this example:

```java
/// Javadoc text is written here,
/// wrapped normally...
public int method(String p1) { ... }
```

The *basic* formatting of Traditional Javadoc blocks is as seen in this example:

```java
/**
 * Multiple lines of Javadoc text are written here,
 * wrapped normally...
 */
public int method(String p1) { ... }
```

... or in this single-line example:

```java
/** An especially short bit of Javadoc. */
```

The basic form is always acceptable. The single-line form may be substituted when the entirety of the Javadoc block (including comment markers) can fit on a single line. Note that this only applies when there are no block tags such as `@param`.

### 7.1.2 Paragraphs

With Traditional Javadoc, one blank line—that is, a line containing only the aligned leading asterisk (`*`)—appears between paragraphs, and before the group of block tags if present. Each paragraph except the first has `<p>` immediately before the first word, with no space after it. HTML tags for other block-level elements, such as `<ul>` or `<table>`, are *not* preceded with `<p>`.

With Markdown Javadoc, paragraphs are separated as usual for Markdown, by a line that is blank apart from the leading `///`. No `<p>` is needed.

### 7.1.3 Block tags

Any of the standard "block tags" that are used appear in the order `@param`, `@return`, `@throws`, `@deprecated`, and these four types never appear with an empty description. When a block tag doesn't fit on a single line, continuation lines are indented four (or more) spaces from the position of the `@` for Traditional Javadoc, and exactly two spaces for Markdown Javadoc. (A four-space indentation in Markdown is interpreted as an indented code block in some contexts.)

## 7.2 The summary fragment

Each Javadoc block begins with a brief **summary fragment**. This fragment is very important: it is the only part of the text that appears in certain contexts such as class and method indexes.

This is a fragment—a noun phrase or verb phrase, not a complete sentence. It does **not** begin with ~~``A `Foo` is a...``~~, or ~~`This method returns...`~~, nor does it form a complete imperative sentence like ~~`Save the record.`~~. However, the fragment is capitalized and punctuated as if it were a complete sentence.

> **Tip:** A common mistake is to write simple Javadoc in the form ~~`/// @return the customer ID`~~. This is incorrect, and should be changed to `/// Returns the customer ID.` or `/// {@return the customer ID}`.

## 7.3 Where Javadoc is used

At the *minimum*, Javadoc is present for every *visible* class, member, or record component, with a few exceptions noted below. A top-level class is visible if it is `public`; a member is visible if it is `public` or `protected` and its containing class is visible; and a record component is visible if its containing record is visible.

Additional Javadoc content may also be present, as explained in Section 7.3.4, Non-required Javadoc.

### 7.3.1 Exception: self-explanatory members

Javadoc is optional for "simple, obvious" members and record components, such as a `getFoo()` method, *if* there *really and truly* is nothing else worthwhile to say but "the foo".

> **Important:** it is not appropriate to cite this exception to justify omitting relevant information that a typical reader might need to know. For example, for a record component named `canonicalName`, don't omit its documentation (with the rationale that it would say only ~~`@param canonicalName the canonical name`~~) if a typical reader may have no idea what the term "canonical name" means!

### 7.3.2 Exception: overrides

Javadoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method.

### 7.3.4 Non-required Javadoc

Other classes, members, and record components have Javadoc *as needed or desired*.

Whenever an implementation comment would be used to define the overall purpose or behavior of a class or member, that comment is written as Javadoc instead (using `///` or `/**`).

Non-required Javadoc is not strictly required to follow the formatting rules of Sections 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2, though it is of course recommended.
